				<p>The integration of Machine Learning (ML) and ML Operations (MLOps) onto Internet of Things (IoT) resource-constrained devices is revolutionising how smart wireless networks operate and evolve. ML techniques, evolving from self-supervised to reinforcement learning and beyond, offer rich solutions for optimising the efficiency and functionality of IoT networks. The focus on deploying and monitoring ML systems within these settings emphasises the need for innovative approaches that navigate the constraints of limited computational power, data availability, and energy resources. As MLOps methodologies evolve, they must address the dual challenges of integrating complex ML workflows into devices that are inherently limited in capacity while ensuring that these systems can be monitored, updated, and maintained with minimal overhead.</p>
				<p>These technologies face the challenge of operating in environments with limited data, power, and computational resources, requiring models and pipelines that can adapt to new scenarios with minimal supervision and perform efficiently on low-resource devices. This demands a fusion of deep IoT system insights with advanced ML knowledge to develop practical solutions that enhance IoT networks' capabilities. The essence of deploying ML models in such contexts lies in leveraging advanced techniques that allow for real-time analytics, predictive maintenance, and autonomous decision-making on edge while operating within the stringent parameters of IoT devices.</p>
				<p>This workshop wants to bring together researchers from the IoT and ML communities, to explore interdisciplinary approaches for developing ML algorithms and pipelines suited for IoT's unique environments where resources are a premium, and to engage in a lively debate on all facets of ML operations. The workshop will provide an avenue for learning about each other's challenges and methodologies and for debating future research agendas to jointly define the integration of ML on the IoT networks from a system perspective.</p>
				<p>For the workshop's 2nd edition, we invite researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to submit papers that focus on one of the following:</p>
				<ul>
